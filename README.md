## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

This was built using a Joke API that returns random jokes. I add an optional parameter so the user could search for specific jokes. Once the request for a joke is returned, showed the response to the user using Javascript to place it in the DOM.

## Lessons Learned:

Initially this only had the option of selecting a random joke but I also learned to add additional parameters to filter it out further.
